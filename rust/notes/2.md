# Guessing gaem

```rust
```

## Objectives
- control flow
- let, mut

## What to program:
- ask input output

### What happens in program:

#### The programm:
```rust
use std::io;  // standard library

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let mut guess = String::new(); // creates variable to store input

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

#### Dissection:

- Import standard library

    ```rust
        use std::io;  // standard library
    ```

- Set new variable

    ```rust
        let mut guess = String::new(); // creates variable to store input

        let apples = 5; // But also like this

    ```
    - In rust all values are immutable by default (can't change after declaration). More to come on this.
    - In this part we want to bind new variable type String to mutable variable guess.
        - This variable is empty

- Input from user

    ```rust
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
    ```
    - uses function from standard library that takes input.
    - '&' means that the argument is passed by a reference
    - References are:
        - immutable by default
        - way to let multiple parts of code access one piece of data without needing to copy the data into memory multiple times

- Error handling

    ```rust
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
    ```
    - Expect means what happens if the guess did not come/is wrong
    - In compiling I would get something like:
        ```rust
        $ cargo build
        Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        warning: unused `Result` that must be used
        --> src/main.rs:10:5
        |
        10 |     io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
        |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        |
        = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled
        = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
        help: use `let _ = ...` to ignore the resulting value
        |
        10 |     let _ = io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
        |     +++++++

- F-print
    - To do something like this:
        ```python
        x = "Hello World!"
        print(f"{x}")
        ```    

    - I can do something like this in rust:
    ```rust
    lex = 5;
    println!("x = {x}")
    ```

## Cargo.toml packages:

- To add random generated number I will use library called: rand. To add it I have to simply:
    ```rust
    ...

    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8.5
    ```

    - now this shows versions 0.8.5 -> which is shorthand for ^0.8.5 meaning:
        - at least 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0
            - 0.8.5 =< version < 0.9.0


## Generating new random number

- Generate random number
    ```rust
    let secret_number = rand::rng().random_range(1..=100);
    ```

    - start .. end

## Comparing

- Compare numbers
    ```rust
        use std::cmp::Ordering;
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    ```

    - Ordering is an enum and has variants <span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Less</span>, <span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Equal</span>, <span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Greater</span>

    - cmp compares two values for anything comparable
        - takes reference to whatever you want to compare
        - it returns variant of Ordering Enum (<span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Less</span>, <span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Equal</span>, <span style="background:#93c5fd;color:#0f172a;">Greater</span>)
        
    - match expression is made up of arms.
        - consists of pattern to match against
        - takes value given to match and looks through each arm's pattern in turn.

### Comparison worked out example:

- cmp returns Ordering::Greater/... 
    - compares first Less, then Greater. Whatever matches then prints match statement

### Equality:

- Rust is statically typed, can compare only same type.


### While loop

```rust
    loop {
        // do something
    }
```

### Exiting when match

```rust
    loop {
        
        ... // do something
        
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),

            // exit if equal
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
```
